INSTRUCTIONS

A player can choose to host a new room or join an existing room by tapping the corresponding button in the main menu and entering both a nickname for themselves and a room name to host/join. Once a room has a minimum of three (3) players its host can start the game, becoming the first Card Czar. Each player receives six (6) cards in their hands, and may (with the exception of the Czar) play one (1) card each turn in response to the prompt card visible to all players. The Card Czar then chooses the answer they like the most, and the player who played that card receives one point. Once the turn ends each player draws a new card to replace the one they played, the role of Czar rotates onto the next player, and a new prompt card is drawn. The game progress until one player reaches the point limit, when everybody wins! Huzzah!
