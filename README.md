INSTRUCTIONS

A player can choose to host a new room or join an existing room by tapping the corresponding button in the main menu and entering both a nickname for themselves and a room name to host/join. Once a room has a minimum of three (3) players its host can start the game, becoming the first Card Czar to serve the motherland. Each player receives six (6) cards in their hands, and may (with the exception of the Czar) play one (1) card each turn in response to the prompt card visible to all players. The Card Czar then chooses the answer they feel best improves the happiness of the people, and rewards the player who played that card one (1) point. Once the turn ends each player draws a new card to replace the one they played, the next player in the gme's rotation is given the privilege to be come the Czar, and a new prompt card is drawn. The game progress until one player reaches the point limit, when everybody wins! Hurrah for socialism!

TROUBLESHOOTING (F.A.Q.s)

"Sorry, if it F.A.Q.ed up, you did it wrong. Clearly our gloriously Arstozkan developers cannot be held at fault."
Good luck shooting at your troubles, my comrade-in-arms.
Heh, always wanted to say that.
Now in all seriousness, please do keep in mind the fragility of this product as a makeshift framework barely made in time to be functional at all, that the product is built without any security or failsafe features at time of writing, that this app runs on the assumption that FireBase is alive and working well, and we will look into tackling security and compatibility issues if we decide to continue this project, and hey--at least we haven't nuked your cities. Yet.
